## Anthropic

This directory contains pre-built samples and solutions to help customers get started with the **Generative AI** using **AWS** services and **Anthropic**.

## Get Started

### Prerequisites

- Follow these [steps](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/model-access.html) to grant access to the Anthropic Claude model of your choice.

### Project setup

#### Local
Follow these [steps](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html) to install AWS CLI in your local environment.

## Navigating the Directory
This directory is subdivided into two sub directories samples and solutions. 
- **samples** sub directory contains small code samples and snippets which can be used to complete small sets of actions and can be integrated into the user code. 
- **solutions** sub directory contains solutions for some use cases and industry scenarios, which can be easily customized and built into full scale production systems.
